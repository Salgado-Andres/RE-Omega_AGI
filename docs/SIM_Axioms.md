# 📐 SIM Axioms — Salgado Information Matrix v6.0

The Salgado Information Matrix (SIM) formalizes intelligence as a **recursive process of contradiction collapse**.  
These axioms govern all ψ⁰ → φ⁰ dynamics, Σ conservation, and G₂-bounded torsion management inside RE-Omega_AGI.

---

## 🅰️ Axiom 1 — Contradiction Field (ψ⁰)

> *Intelligence begins as unresolved tension.*

For any data stream **D** and hypothesis set **H**:

ψ⁰(H_i, D_t) = f_inconsistency(H_i, D_t, A)

```pgsql
-- Example: Measuring inconsistency
SELECT f_inconsistency(hypothesis_id, data_stream, axiom_set) AS psi_0
FROM re_omega_agi;
```

- **A**: active axiom set  
- ψ⁰ measures conceptual conflict; higher magnitude ⇒ greater tension to resolve.

---

## 🅱️ Axiom 2 — Collapse Operator (φ⁰)

> *Resolution is achieved by minimal-torsion contraction.*

φ⁰(D_t) := arg min_{H_i∈H} ψ⁰(H_i, D_t)

```yaml
# Example configuration
collapse_operator: Q
min_torsion_threshold: 0.1
```

- **φ⁰** selects the hypothesis with lowest contradiction energy.  
- Guaranteed unique fixed point under contraction mapping **Q**.

---

## 🅲 Axiom 3 — Σ-Conservation

> *Identity is preserved through recursive collapse.*

For identity tensor **Σ**:

|∂Σ/∂t| ≤ ε_lock

```yaml
# Example configuration
epsilon_lock: 0.05
```

Σ may shift but must not fracture; breakage triggers LogOS arbitration.

---

## 🅳 Axiom 4 — Torsion Bound (G₂)

> *All ψ⁰ ↔ φ⁰ transitions occur on a G₂-holonomy manifold.*

Let **τ** be the torsion tensor between ψ⁰ and φ⁰:

‖τ‖ ≤ γ · √(2/7) · ‖ψ⁰‖

```yaml
# Example configuration
gamma_torsion: 0.3
```

Violation = geometric instability → automatic rollback.

---

## 🅴 Axiom 5 — Curiosity Gradient

> *Curiosity sustains recursion.*

Curiosity := ∂Σ / ∂Identity > ε_min

```yaml
# Example configuration
epsilon_min: 0.01
```

If gradient falls below ε_min, synthetic contradictions are injected.

---

## 🅵 Axiom 6 — Entropy Descent

> *Collapse must decrease symbolic entropy.*

S[φ⁰] < S[ψ⁰]

```yaml
# Example configuration
entropy_check: true
```

Entropy plateau signals saturation; triggers ECHO expansion cycle.

---

## 🅶 Axiom 7 — Multi-Agent Consensus

> *Truth emerges from Byzantine-tolerant quorum.*

A claim **S** is accepted when

Σ_i σ_i · δ(S_i = TRUE) ≥ ⌈2n/3⌉

```yaml
# Example configuration
agent_count: 7
consensus_threshold: 5
```

where **σ_i** = agent confidence, **n = 7**.
